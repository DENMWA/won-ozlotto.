# ðŸ§  Won-OzLotto: Hybrid Oz Lotto Predictor

A powerful **Oz Lotto prediction engine** using hybrid techniques that blend:
- Constructive prediction (Mode C)
- Statistical post-filter scoring with adjustable weights (Final Formula: Î±, Î², Î³)

Built in **Python** with **Streamlit**, this app allows you to simulate, score, and optimize your number sets using entropy, Mahalanobis distance, and historical frequency patterns.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Predictive Modes
- **Mode C â€“ Constructive Prediction**: Dynamically builds 7-number sets from [1â€“47] using:
  - Fourier frequency boosts
  - Entropy normalization
  - Co-draw probability filters
  - Randomized cryptographic weights

- **Final Formula Post-Scoring**: Uses adjustable Î±, Î², Î³ to tune:
  - Frequency weighting
  - Hot zone & cold zone pressure
  - Entropy bonus and Mahalanobis distance for set diversity

### ðŸ“Š Visual Tools
- Live bar chart of simulated historical frequencies
- Slider-adjustable formula weights (Î±, Î², Î³)
- Entropy, sequential gap penalty, and co-draw logic

### ðŸ“¥ Output Options
- Displays top 10 highest-scoring prediction sets
- Allows CSV export of prediction sets
